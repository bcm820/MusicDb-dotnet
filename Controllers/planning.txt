1. Index: Lists all artists stored in DB
2. Search results: Lists all API results from search string
3. Artist profile: Lists DB artist info

Bugs:

Later:

2. Add Twitter and Instagram data to artist profile
3. Setup simple login/reg
4. Only store artists and songs in DB via User likes (learn auth)
5. Index: Add DB songs to index
